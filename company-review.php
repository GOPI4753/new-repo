<h4>Microsoft</h4>
<P>Liked it. Sometimes, I did my job but most of the time I'd come in the back door so Lumberg doesn't see me. Then I just stare at my screen and zone out. I do that again after lunch for smoother hours. I would say in a given week, I only do about 15 minutes of actual work - Software Engineer (Former Employee) - Pasadena, CA</P>
<P>I've been with the company for 8+ years starting in the Steve Balmer days. The culture we're shifting towards today is a much healthier environment. There are seeds of "old" hats but those are being shifted and working out. It's such a large company that you can't say its all good or it's all bad. If you find a great team that is adopting the inclusive, fail fast, growth mindset culture, jump at the chance - Senior Program Manager (Current Employee) - Redmond, WA</P>
