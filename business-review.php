    <h2>Automobile</h2>
    <h4>Ford</h4>
    
    <p>Even after being around for such a long time, the EcoSport still is the most handsome looking brute in the sub-four meter SUV segment. Its bold grille, large aggressive headlamps, well-designed fog lamp housing, wraparound C-pillar, muscular creases, and haunches- all lend it a very American muscle-esque persona - Bilal Ahmed</p>
    <P>Fords have been known for their road dynamics and the EcoSport is no different. Its well-balanced steering wheel coupled with well-judged ride quality make this Blue Oval one of the best driver's vehicles in its segment. Take it over any road surface (or no road for that matter) and the ride remains flat and consistent without troubling the passengers. Combine this with the direct and well-weighted steering and the EcoSport emerges as an ideal choice for those who like spending more time behind the wheel - Bilal Ahmed</p>
    <h4>Maruti</h4>
   <p>   We got our first taste of the Wagon R in the more powerful of its two avatars. We’ve already experienced the 83hp, 1.2-litre engine on the Ignis, Baleno, Swift and Dzire and know it as a peppy and refined unit. However, the engine adds a whole new dimension of performance to the lightweight Wagon R - Shapur Kotwal</p>
    <P>Larger on the inside, now available with a more powerful engine, better-equipped and better-built, the new Wagon R has a lot to offer. It’s fairly well-priced too. Remember that this is not a car to buy if you enjoy driving, and its appliance-like character won’t appeal to enthusiasts either. What the Wagon R does is retain its original formula of an incredibly functional budget car. For spaciousness and sheer practicality, the new Maruti Suzuki Wagon R is still the car to beat - Shapur Kotwal</P>
    <P>The Swift has seen more wholesome usage and has played the role of a weekend-getaway car, an airport-run 
    car. In fact, the rear seats were put to more use in the last two months than the six before. Journalistic 
    curiosity had me work the car into the conversation to get a sense of what my rear passengers felt about it, 
    and the points were quite mixed. Those familiar with the Swifts of old were amazed by the legroom at the back. 
    The latest Swift really feels like a family car, that’s for sure - Shapur Kotwal </p>
    <h4>Hyundai</h4>
    <p>The Hyundai Grand i10, or the second-gen i10, stays on sale in the country even after the launch of the third-gen model, which has gone on sale as the Grand i10 Nos. The Grand i10 has a spacious cabin, offers some great features and has been available with both petrol and Diesel engine options. The Grand i10 has been the second-most popular car in the segment, after the Maruti Swift - CARS24 </p>
    <P>Hyundai Elite i20, The Maruti Baleno rival from Hyundai comes with three engine options – 1.2-litre petrol, 1.4-litre petrol and 1.4-litre diesel. It offers a spacious and an up market cabin and even has a great ride quality. All these traits make it one of the best hatchback cars around - CARS24</p>
    <h2>Super Market</h2>

	<p>A typical day at work starts with review of previous day / week performance of all stores in the region (review of Footfalls, No. Of Bills, Sales, Avg. Bill Value), identifying gaps/issues if any alarming trend observed. Moving on from there to mails, review of execution of current week's plans, status quo check, general discussion with merchandising team on business & support needed, following up with agencies on work progress.
